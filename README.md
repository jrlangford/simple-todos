#Simple Todos

This is a simple webapp based on the simple todos [tutorial](https://www.meteor.com/tutorials/blaze/creating-an-app) for Meteor.
Its main purpose is to show how [ground:db](https://github.com/GroundMeteor/db) can be used to store data locally instead of relying on a remote database.

##Usage

###Android
* Connect your Android device and enable "USB Debugging" under `Settings > Developer Options`
* Run the following command:
```
$ meteor run android-device
```
